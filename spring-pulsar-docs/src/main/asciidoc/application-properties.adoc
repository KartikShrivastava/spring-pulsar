= Application Properties

You can specify various properties inside your `application.properties` file, inside your `application.yml` file, or as command line switches.
This appendix provides a list of Spring Pulsar properties and references to the underlying classes that consume them.

TIP: Spring Boot provides various conversion mechanisms with advanced value formatting. See <<features#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion, the properties conversion section>> for more detail.

NOTE: Property contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath, so this list is not exhaustive.
Also, you can define your own properties.
